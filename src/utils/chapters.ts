  //   title: "Prologue: A Snowy Morning in New York",
  //   content: `On a snowy winter morning in New York City, Zara and Zen sat bundled in warm jackets, sipping coffee and chatting on a busy 5th Avenue sidewalk. As snowflakes danced around them, they dreamed of distant lands and faraway adventures. Inspired by the books they'd read and the stories they'd heard, they decided it was time to explore the world themselves. With wagging tails and beating hearts, they raced home to plan their journey.`,

    title: "Chapter 1: Blossoms of Japan",
    content: `Zara and Zen’s first stop was Japan, just in time for cherry blossom season. They strolled through Kyoto’s historic streets, marveled at the golden Kinkaku-ji temple, and shared sweet mochi under blooming sakura trees. They dressed in tiny dog-sized kimonos and bowed politely to locals, eager to learn every bit of the culture. One highlight? Watching real sumo wrestlers train—Zen even tried to mimic them, much to Zara's amusement.`,

    title: "Chapter 2: Mysteries Along the Great Wall",
    content: `In China, the duo hiked the breathtaking Great Wall at dusk. With bamboo hats and glowing red lanterns, they explored winding stone paths while laughing and chasing the wind. Zara packed a picnic of colorful dim sum, and they sat gazing out over ancient mountain ridges. Along the way, they uncovered a hidden scroll that hinted at an ancient dog hero’s legend, setting them on a new mission.`,

    title: "Chapter 3: Lanterns of Thailand",
    content: `Next, Zara and Zen arrived in Chiang Mai during the Yi Peng lantern festival. Lanterns floated into the sky like stars, and the dogs joined local children in crafting paper lanterns with wishes inside. They tasted mango sticky rice, rode a tuk-tuk through bustling night markets, and learned how to greet others with a respectful “wai.” Zen got slightly too excited at the floating lanterns and accidentally toppled a flower stand—luckily, everyone laughed.`,

    title: "Chapter 4: Gardens in the Sky – Singapore",
    content: `In Singapore, Zara and Zen marveled at the futuristic Supertree Grove in Gardens by the Bay. They sniffed fragrant orchids and posed beneath a stunning rainbow that arced over misty mountains in the distance. The duo explored Changi Airport, finding a butterfly garden, movie theater, and even a rooftop pool! They admired the city’s mix of cultures—from Little India to Chinatown—and were warmly welcomed everywhere they went.`,

    title: "Chapter 5: K-Dramas and Hanboks in Seoul",
    content: `Zara and Zen’s trip to South Korea was full of fun contrasts—traditional palaces by day and sparkling city lights by night. In Seoul, they wore colorful hanboks while visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace and watched the royal guard ceremony. At night, they snacked on tteokbokki and visited a dog café where they made furry new friends. They even starred in a mini K-drama scene filmed by a street artist!`,

    title: "Chapter 6: Colors of India",
    content: `Their final stop was India, where vibrant sights, scents, and sounds overwhelmed their senses in the best way. They danced in a Holi celebration, tails splattered with colors as they chased each other through joyful crowds. At the Taj Mahal, they gazed in awe and whispered about love and legacy. They rode tuk-tuks through Jaipur’s pink streets and found peace during a quiet sunset on the Ganges River, reflecting on all they’d learned.`,
