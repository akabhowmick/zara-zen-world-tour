## 🌍 Overview

Z&Z World is an interactive, story-driven web experience built with React.
The website follows two main characters — Zara and Zen — as they travel across countries, meeting unique local characters, learning life lessons, and exploring global culture through art, storytelling, and mini-games.

This project includes:

- A Chapters system (Asia + Europe arcs)
- A Characters viewer
